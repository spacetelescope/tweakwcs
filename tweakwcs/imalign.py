def fit_wcs(refcat, imcat, tpwcs, fitgeom='general', nclip=3,

    """ "Tweak" **a single** image's ``WCS`` by fitting image catalog to a
    reference catalog. This is a simplified version of `align_wcs` that does
    not perform matching and is limited to the fitting part.

    .. note::
        Both reference and image catalogs must have been **matched**
        *prior to* calling ``fit_wcs()``. This means that the lengths of both
        ``refcat`` and ``imcat`` catalogs must be equal *and* that coordinates
        with the same indices in both catalogs correspond to the same source.

    .. warning::
        If ``tpwcs.meta`` dictionary contains ``'catalog'`` keyword,
        it will be ignored.

    Parameters
    ----------
    refcat: astropy.table.Table
        A reference source catalog. The catalog must contain ``'RA'`` and
        ``'DEC'`` columns which indicate reference source world
        coordinates (in degrees). An optional column in the catalog is
        the ``'weight'`` column, which when present, will be used in fitting.
        See ``Notes`` section for further details.

    imcat: astropy.table.Table
        Source catalog associated with an image whose WCS needs to be aligned
        by fitting a linear transformation to ``imcat`` source positions so as
        to align them to the same sources from the ``refcat`` catalog.
        Must contain ``'x'`` and ``'y'`` columns which indicate source
        coordinates (in pixels) in the associated image. An optional column in
        the catalog is the ``'weight'`` column, which when present, will be
        used in fitting. See ``Notes`` section for further details.

    tpwcs: TPWCS
        A ``WCS`` associated with the image from which the catalog was derived.
        This ``TPWCS``-subclassed WCS corrector object must also define
        a tangent plane that will be used for fitting the two catalogs'
        sources and in which WCS corrections will be applied.

    fitgeom: {'shift', 'rscale', 'general'}, optional
        The fitting geometry to be used in fitting the matched object lists.
        This parameter is used in fitting the offsets, rotations and/or scale
        changes from the matched object lists. The 'general' fit geometry
        allows for independent scale and rotation for each axis.

    nclip: int, None, optional
        Number (a non-negative integer) of clipping iterations in fit.
        Clipping will be turned off if ``nclip`` is either `None` or 0.

    sigma: float, tuple of the form (float, str), optional
        When a tuple is provided, first value (a positive number)
        indicates the number of "fit error estimates" to use for clipping.
        The second value (a string) indicates the statistic to be
        used for "fit error estimate". Currently the following values are
        supported: ``'rmse'``, ``'mae'``, and ``'std'``
        - see `~tweakwcs.linearfit.iter_linear_fit` for more details.

        When ``sigma`` is a single number, it must be a positive number and
        the default error estimate ``'rmse'`` is assumed.

        This parameter is ignored when ``nclip`` is either `None` or 0.

    Returns
    -------
    twwcs: TPWCS
        "Tweaked" (aligned) ``WCS`` that contains tangent-plane corrections
        so that reference and image catalog sources better align in the tangent
        plane and therefore on the sky as well.

    Notes
    -----
    When fitting image sources to reference catalog sources, we can specify
    which sources have higher weights. This can be done by assigning a "weight"
    to each source by specifying these values in the optional ``'weight'``
    column of either the reference catalog, image catalog, or both.

    When weights are not provided, all sources are weighed equally. When
    only either image or reference catalog weights are provided, the sources
    will be weighted with the specified weights. When *both* image *and*
    reference catalogs specify weights for the same sources, the two weights
    will be combined into a single weight as:

    .. math::
        1/w = 1/w_i + 1/w_r

    .. warning::
        Keep in mind that when a group catalog is created from individual
        catalogs, weights of the group catalog are created by
        *concatenating* weights of individual catalogs. Therefore,
        for the weighting of groups of catalogs to work correctly,
        the weights of individual catalogs should be scaled in such a way
        that when individual catalogs are combined into a single
        "group catalog", weights preserve their relative values.

        For example, let's say a group is formed from two individual
        catalogs. Let's say first catalog contains four sources with equal
        weights ``[1,1,1,1]`` and the second catalog contains two sources
        with weights ``[1,1]`` then the group's catalogs sources will
        also have equal weights ``[1,1,1,1,1,1]``. However, if each
        individual catalog's weights were normalized such that sum of
        all weights is 1, then group's sources will be weighed unequally:
        ``[0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.5,0.5]``.

    Upon **successful** completion, this function will set the ``'fit_info'``
    key value of the ``meta`` attribute of the returned ``TPWCS`` object.
    ``'fit_info'`` is a dictionary with the following items:

        * **'shift'**: A ``numpy.ndarray`` with two components of the
          computed shift.

        * **'matrix'**: A ``2x2`` ``numpy.ndarray`` with the computed
          generalized rotation matrix.

        * **'proper_rot'**: Rotation angle (degree) as if the rotation is
          proper.

        * **'rot'**: A tuple of ``(rotx, roty)`` - the rotation angles with
          regard to the ``X`` and ``Y`` axes.

        * **'<rot>'**: *Arithmetic mean* of the angles of rotation around
          ``X`` and ``Y`` axes.

        * **'scale'**: A tuple of ``(sx, sy)`` - scale change in the direction
          of the ``X`` and ``Y`` axes.

        * **'<scale>'**: *Geometric mean* of scales ``sx`` and ``sy``.

        * **'skew'**: Computed skew.

        * **'proper'**: a boolean indicating whether the rotation is proper.

        * **'fitgeom'**: Fit geometry (allowed transformations) used for
          fitting data (to minimize residuals). This is copy of the input
          argument ``fitgeom``.

        * **'center'**: Center of rotation in the *tangent plane* of the
          computed linear transformations.

        * **'fitmask'**: A boolean array indicating which source positions
          where used for fitting (`True`) and which were clipped out
          (`False`). **NOTE:** For weighted fits, positions with zero
          weights are automatically excluded from the fits.

        * **'eff_nclip'**: Effective number of clipping iterations

        * **'rmse'**: fit Root-Mean-Square Error in *tangent plane*
          coordinates of corrected image source positions from reference
          source positions.

        * **'mae'**: fit Mean Absolute Error in *tangent plane*
          coordinates of corrected image source positions from reference
          source positions.

        * **'std'**: Norm of the standard deviation of the residuals
          in *tangent plane* along each axis.

        * **'resids'**: An array of residuals of the fit in the
          *tangent plane*.

          **NOTE:** Only the residuals for the "valid" points are reported
          here. Therefore the length of this array may be smaller than the
          length of input arrays of positions.

        * **'fit_RA'**: first (corrected) world coordinate of input source
          positions used in fitting.

        * **'fit_DEC'**: second (corrected) world coordinate of input
          source positions used in fitting.

        * **'status'**: Alignment status. Currently two possible status are
          possible ``'SUCCESS'`` or ``'FAILED: reason for failure'``.
          When alignment failed, the reason for failure is provided after
          alignment status.

    Align (groups of) image catalogs by adjusting the parameters of their
    WCS based on fits between matched sources in these catalogs and a reference
    catalog which may be automatically created from one of the input ``wcscat``
    catalogs.

    .. warning::
        This function modifies the ``wcs`` attribute of each item
        in the input ``wcscat`` list!

    Upon completion, this function will add a field ``'fit_info'``
    to the ``meta`` attribute of the input WCS correctors (except of the one
    chosen as a reference catalog when ``refcat`` is `None`) containing
    a dictionary describing matching and fit results. For a description
    of the items in this dictionary, see

    status set by :meth:`~tweakwcs.wcsimage.WCSGroupCatalog.align_to_ref`,
    this function may set status to ``'REFERENCE'`` for an input image used
    as a reference image when a reference catalog is not provided.
    In this case no other fields in the ``'fit_info'`` will be present
    because a reference image is not being aligned. When alignment failed,

    Parameters
    ----------
    wcscat: tweakwcs.tpwcs.TPWCS, list of tweakwcs.tpwcs.TPWCS
        A list of all `~tweakwcs.tpwcs.TPWCS`-derived WCS correctors whose
        ``meta`` dictionary **must** contain ``'catalog'``
        item with a non-empty table value of type `astropy.table.Table`.
        This catalog must contain ``'x'`` and ``'y'`` columns which indicate
        source coordinates (in pixels) in the associated image. An optional
        column in the catalog is the ``'weight'`` column, which when present,
        will be used in fitting. See ``Notes`` section for further details.
        In addition to ``'catalog'``, the following items in the ``meta``
        dictionary are recognized/supported: ``'name'`` and ``'group_id'``.
        ``'name'`` is catalog's name and it used to identify catalog during
        logging. If ``'name'`` value is `None` or not present at all in the
        ``meta`` of a catalog, the name of that catalog will reported as
        ``'Unknown'``. Group ID that may be used for identifying catalogs
        that need to be aligned together. ``group_id`` must be hashable.
        If ``'group_id'`` is `None` or not provided, each input WCS/catalog
        will be aligned individually.

        .. note::
            Upon completion this function will add ``'fit_info'``
            item (a dictionary) to input object's ``meta`` dictionary.
            See **Notes** section for more details.

        .. warning::
            This function modifies the WCS of ``TPWCS`` objects by calling
            their :py:meth:`~tweakwcs.tpwcs.TPWCS.set_correction` method.

    refcat: astropy.table.Table, optional
        A reference source catalog. The catalog must contain ``'RA'`` and
        ``'DEC'`` columns which indicate reference source world
        coordinates (in degrees). An optional column in the catalog is
        the ``'weight'`` column, which when present, will be used in fitting.
        See ``Notes`` section for further details.

    enforce_user_order: bool, optional
        Specifies whether images should be aligned in the order specified in
        the `file` input parameter or `align` should optimize the order
        of alignment by intersection area of the images. Default value (`True`)
        will align images in the user specified order, except when some images
        cannot be aligned in which case `align` will optimize the image
        alignment order. Alignment order optimization is available *only*
        when ``expand_refcat`` is `True`.

    expand_refcat: bool, optional
        Specifies whether to add new sources from just matched images to
        the reference catalog to allow next image to be matched against an
        expanded reference catalog. By delault, the reference catalog is not
        being expanded.

        If ``refcat`` is not `None` and contains an ``'id'`` column, then
        sources being added to the reference catalog will be assigned
        consecutive IDs that continue maximum ID in the ``refcat``.

        If one desires to uniquely associate source in the expanded catalog
        to their original catalogs, it is recommended that one assign unique
        IDs to all sources in all input catalogs **and** in the reference
        catalog in a separate column such as ``'uuid'``.

    minobj: int, None, optional
        Minimum number of identified objects from each input image to use
        in matching objects from other images. If the default `None` value is
        used then `align` will automatically deternmine the minimum number
        of sources from the value of the ``fitgeom`` parameter.

    match: MatchCatalogs, function, None, optional
        A callable that takes two arguments: a reference catalog and an
        image catalog. Both catalogs will have columns ``'TPx'`` and
        ``'TPy'`` that represent the source coordinates in some common
        (to both catalogs) coordinate system.

    fitgeom: {'shift', 'rscale', 'general'}, optional
        The fitting geometry to be used in fitting the matched object lists.
        This parameter is used in fitting the offsets, rotations and/or scale
        changes from the matched object lists. The 'general' fit geometry
        allows for independent scale and rotation for each axis.

    nclip: int, None, optional
        Number (a non-negative integer) of clipping iterations in fit.
        Clipping will be turned off if ``nclip`` is either `None` or 0.

    sigma: float, tuple of the form (float, str), optional
        When a tuple is provided, first value (a positive number)
        indicates the number of "fit error estimates" to use for clipping.
        The second value (a string) indicates the statistic to be
        used for "fit error estimate". Currently the following values are
        supported: ``'rmse'``, ``'mae'``, and ``'std'``
        - see `~tweakwcs.linearfit.iter_linear_fit` for more details.

        When ``sigma`` is a single number, it must be a positive number and
        the default error estimate ``'rmse'`` is assumed.

        This parameter is ignored when ``nclip`` is either `None` or 0.

    Returns
    -------
    eff_refcat: astropy.table.Table
        Effective reference catalog used for aligning all images. Depending
        on the values of the input parameters ``refcat``,
        ``enforce_user_order``, and ``expand_refcat``, effective
        reference catalog may be one of the input image catalogs, the original
        ``refcat`` catalog, an expanded ``refcat`` with a combination of
        source positions from all input images.

    Notes
    -----
    **1. Weights:**

    When fitting image sources to reference catalog sources, we can specify
    which sources have higher weights. This can be done by assigning a "weight"
    to each source by specifying these values in the optional ``'weight'``
    column of either the reference catalog, image catalog, or both.

    When weights are not provided, all sources are weighed equally. When
    only either image or reference catalog weights are provided, the sources
    will be weighted with the specified weights. When *both* image *and*
    reference catalogs specify weights for the same sources, the two weights
    will be combined into a single weight as:

    .. math::
        1/w = 1/w_i + 1/w_r

    .. warning::
        Keep in mind that when a group catalog is created from individual
        catalogs, weights of the group catalog are created by
        *concatenating* weights of individual catalogs. Therefore,
        for the weighting of groups of catalogs to work correctly,
        the weights of individual catalogs should be scaled in such a way
        that when individual catalogs are combined into a single
        "group catalog", weights preserve their relative values.

        For example, let's say a group is formed from two individual
        catalogs. Let's say first catalog contains four sources with equal
        weights ``[1,1,1,1]`` and the second catalog contains two sources
        with weights ``[1,1]`` then the group's catalogs sources will
        also have equal weights ``[1,1,1,1,1,1]``. However, if each
        individual catalog's weights were normalized such that sum of
        all weights is 1, then group's sources will be weighed unequally:
        ``[0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.5,0.5]``.

    .. warning::
        When image catalogs contain optional ``'weight'`` column, then
        all image catalogs in a group must contain this column.

    **2.** ``'fit_info'``:

    Upon completion, this function will add ``'fit_info'``
    item (itself a dictionary) to input object's ``meta`` dictionary.
    If input objects are `~tweakwcs.tpwcs.TPWCS` WCS correctors, then
    ``TPWCS.meta['fit_info']`` will be set to a dictionary containing
    fit information.

    .. note::
        For `~tweakwcs.tpwcs.TPWCS` that are aligned in a group,
        the ``'matrix'`` and ``'shift'`` items in the ``'fit_info'``
        dictionary may differ from
        the values of the same items in ``TPWCS.meta`` dictionary. This is
        normal since WCS corrections (in `~tweakwcs.tpwcs.TPWCS`) are applied
        in the image's WCS plane while fit may be performed in a slightly
        different tangent plane.
